# Bank-Names-Reconciliation
Code to perform record alignment of banks and bank holding companies

What the code does:
* Scrapes lists of bank holding companies and ticker per US region from www.barchart.com
* Reconciles the BHC names with names contained in the FDIC institutions database

Names are first pre-processed to remove things such as "Corp". "Corporation", "Inc.", etc.
